<h2>I</h2><h3>Frisky Squirrel Finds Much To Do</h3>
</div>


<p>Frisky Squirrel was a lively little chap. And he was very bold, too. You
see, he was so nimble that he felt he could always jump right out of
danger&mdash;no matter whether it was a hawk chasing him, or a fox springing
at him, or a boy throwing stones at him. He would chatter and scold at
his enemies from some tree-top. And it was seldom that he was so
<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_10' id='Page_10'>[Pg 10]</a></span>frightened that he ran home and hid inside his mother&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Squirrel&#8217;s house was in a hollow limb of a hickory tree. It was a
very convenient place to live; for although the tree was old, it still
bore nuts. And it is very pleasant to be able to step out of your house
and find your dinner all ready for you&mdash;simply waiting to be picked.</p>

<p>Of course, Frisky Squirrel and his mother couldn&#8217;t find their dinner on
the tree the whole year &#8217;round&mdash;because it was only in the fall that
there were nuts on it. But luckily there were other things to eat&mdash;such
as seeds, of which there were many kinds in the woods. And then there
was Farmer Green&#8217;s wheat&mdash;and his corn, too, which Frisky liked most of
all.</p>

<p>The woods where Mrs. Squirrel and her son lived were full of the finest
trees to climb that anybody could wish for. And Frisky loved to go
leaping from branch to branch, and from tree to tree. He was<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_11' id='Page_11'>[Pg 11]</a></span> so
fearless that he would scamper far out on the ends of the smallest
limbs. But no matter how much they bent and swayed beneath his weight,
he was never afraid; in fact, that was part of the fun.</p>

<p>As she watched Frisky whisking about among the trees, now swinging on
this branch, now leaping far out to that one, Mrs. Squirrel sometimes
wondered how he could keep dashing about so madly. Though the old lady
was pretty spry, herself, she was content to sit still <i>some</i> of the
time. But Frisky Squirrel was almost never still except when he was
asleep. There was so much to do! Frisky wished that the days were
longer, for though he tried his hardest, he couldn&#8217;t climb <i>all</i> the
trees in the forest. Each night he had to give up his task, only to
begin all over again the next morning. If there had been nothing to do
but <i>climb</i> the trees<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_12' id='Page_12'>[Pg 12]</a></span> Frisky would have been able to climb more of
them. But there were other things that took time.</p>

<p>There were the birds, for instance. Frisky simply had to tease them.
Perhaps it was just because he was so full of fun&mdash;or mischief, as it is
sometimes called. Anyhow, he delighted in visiting their nests; and
chasing them; and scolding at them. And it was not always the littlest
birds, either, that Frisky teased. There was that loud-mouthed fellow,
Jasper Jay, the biggest blue jay in the whole neighborhood. Frisky liked
nothing better than bothering Jasper Jay&mdash;for Jasper always lost his
temper and flew straight at Frisky. And then would follow the finest
sport of all.</p>

<p>But a time came at last when Frisky teased Jasper Jay almost once too
often, though that is another story.</p>

<h2>II</h2><h3>Frisky Squirrel has a Fall</h3>
</div>

<p>One day Frisky Squirrel came upon Jasper Jay&#8217;s nest when Jasper and his
wife were both away from home. And Frisky simply couldn&#8217;t resist tearing
a few twigs out of it. He had not done much damage, however, before Mrs.
Jay returned. When she saw what was happening she screamed loudly for
her husband. And soon Jasper came flying up as fast as he could come. He
made a noise exactly like a red-tailed hawk; but he did not frighten
Frisky at all, for Frisky knew all of Jasper&#8217;s tricks. Jasper Jay was
always trying to scare people by calling like bigger<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_14' id='Page_14'>[Pg 14]</a></span> birds&mdash;such as
red-shouldered hawks, and red-tailed hawks, and sparrow hawks.</p>

<p>When Frisky heard him calling he just laughed and skipped up the trunk
of the tree, with Jasper and his wife chasing him. Now, with Jasper and
Mrs. Jay both flying at him, Frisky had to be sprier than ever. But he
was not afraid. He never thought of danger at all. And he ran down the
thick tree-trunk like a flash and bounded across the ground and tore up
the tree where he and his mother lived.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll peck your eyes out!&#8221; Jasper shouted, as he followed close behind
Frisky. Now, no matter how bold one may be, it is not pleasant to hear a
thing like that said. And it made Frisky hurry a little faster.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll peck his tongue out!&#8221; screamed Mrs. Jay. And somehow it disturbed
Frisky the least bit to hear Jasper&#8217;s wife<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_15' id='Page_15'>[Pg 15]</a></span> say that. He decided that he
would go home at once. And he gave a great spring toward the hollow limb
where he lived.</p>

<p>Then something happened that was a great surprise to Frisky Squirrel. He
was right in the middle of his leap when Jasper struck him with a wing.
The blow did not hurt Frisky. But it sent him tumbling. He missed the
hollow limb, and down he went, head over heels, toward the ground.</p>

<p>Even while he was falling, Frisky Squirrel laughed. You see, he thought
it was a good joke on himself. And being a merry little fellow, he was
always ready to laugh when anybody played a joke on him. As for the
fall, that did not trouble him at all. He knew that he could land on his
feet.</p>

<p>It was after he had lighted upon the ground that Frisky was really
frightened.<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_16' id='Page_16'>[Pg 16]</a></span> For when he looked up, whom should he see but Tommy Fox,
not three jumps away! And Tommy Fox was smiling in the most horrid
fashion, as if to say&mdash;&#8220;Ah! I&#8217;ve got you now, my fine fellow!&#8221; And then
Tommy Fox leaped.</p>

<p>But quick as Tommy was, Frisky Squirrel was even quicker. While Tommy
was making one big leap, Frisky was making three smaller leaps. And when
Tommy came down on the spot where Frisky had been he found nothing but a
heap of dry leaves beneath his paws; and in a moment more Frisky
Squirrel&#8217;s gray tail was disappearing through the doorway of his
mother&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>It was very unlucky for Tommy Fox; but then, one might say that it was
very lucky for Frisky Squirrel.</p>

<h2>III</h2><h3>The Stone that Walked</h3>
</div>

<p>One day Frisky Squirrel was playing in the woods when he came upon a
chestnut bur which had lain upon the ground all winter. And in a
twinkling Frisky had picked the nut from inside it and popped it into
his mouth. Then he started home to show his mother what he had found.</p>

<p>But on the way home Frisky began to feel hungry. Just carrying that nut
inside his cheek was a little more than he could stand. And he decided
that he would eat the nut at once, and <i>tell</i> his mother about it,
instead of <i>showing</i> it to her.<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_18' id='Page_18'>[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>So Frisky hopped up on the top of a broad, flat rock. And sitting down
right in the center of it, he began to gnaw at the chestnut. He was so
busy and so interested in what he was doing that before he knew it the
rock began to move. It moved so slowly that it was not until it started
to climb a little hummock, and nearly tipped Frisky over on his back,
that he noticed what was happening.</p>

<p>At first Frisky thought he must be dreaming. He nipped himself with his
sharp teeth to make sure that he was awake. And when he saw that the
rock was really walking right away with him he forgot all about eating
the chestnut. He let it fall out of his paws and roll away; for he had
never seen a rock move like that before.</p>

<p>It was very exciting, though Frisky had never traveled so slowly
before. You<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_19' id='Page_19'>[Pg 19]</a></span> see, whenever he went anywhere he always hurried as if he
had the most important business to attend to. But it was quite different
with that rock. It crawled along just as if it didn&#8217;t care whether it
ever got anywhere or not.</p>

<p>For a long time Frisky clung there. Now and then he almost slipped off
as the rock tilted. But it never tipped quite over; and Frisky managed
to stick on. And then, at last, he decided that he had better hop off
onto the ground, for he noticed that the rock was moving straight toward
the river. It went down the bank at a faster pace. And Frisky leaped off
just in time to escape a wetting, for the next moment the rock dropped
splash! into the water.</p>

<p>Frisky Squirrel waited on the shore and watched it, with eyes wide open
with astonishment. He had expected to see it<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_20' id='Page_20'>[Pg 20]</a></span> sink to the bottom of the
river. But the rock swam away as easily as you please. That was the
strangest part of it all&mdash;a rock which could not only walk, but could
swim as well!</p>

<p>Frisky turned about and ran for home as fast as he could jump. This time
he certainly did have important business. He had such a strange thing to
tell his mother! He reached home quite out of breath. And as soon as he
could, he told Mrs. Squirrel what he had seen.</p>

<p>That good lady did not know what to think. She had always found her son
to be truthful. But this was certainly a queer story. She lay awake a
long time that night thinking about the matter. And early the next
morning she took Frisky and set out for Swift River. Frisky led her to
the very spot where the stone had swum away.<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_21' id='Page_21'>[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;There it is! There it is now!&#8221; he cried, as they paused upon the bank
and he pointed down toward the water&#8217;s edge.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Squirrel saw what Frisky was pointing at she no longer
wondered.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a mud turtle!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;You had a ride on a mud turtle and
you never knew it.&#8221; She smiled, because she was amused; and because she
was happy, too. For she knew that Frisky had told the truth.</p>

<h2>IV</h2><h3>The Picnic</h3>
</div>

<p>It was a fine spring day&mdash;so pleasant that the children from the little
red schoolhouse over the hill came to the woods where Frisky Squirrel
lived. They came for the first picnic of the season, and such a noise as
they made had never been heard in those woods before.</p>

<p>Frisky Squirrel was frightened at first. But at last he grew accustomed
to the uproar, and he crept out on the limb where he lived&mdash;not too far
away from the door&mdash;and looked down and watched the fun.</p>

<p>He was enjoying the picnic quite as much as the merry-makers
themselves&mdash;until<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_23' id='Page_23'>[Pg 23]</a></span> a boy spied him. And then several boys began to throw
acorns at him. Frisky did not like that so well; and he hid in a crotch
of the tree where he could not be seen from below, until the boys forgot
all about him.</p>

<p>When the picnickers went away, Frisky lost no time. He slipped down the
tree in a hurry. You see, he had seen the children eating their lunch
and he hoped he would be able to find some tidbit which they had left
behind them.</p>

<p>Sure enough! there was a feast waiting for him. He was not the only one
who was there to enjoy it. For there were three ruffianly red squirrels
and a half-dozen chipmunks who appeared on the spot as if by magic.</p>

<p>This second picnic soon came to an end, for the dainties did not last
long. But what Frisky found, he enjoyed very much.<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_24' id='Page_24'>[Pg 24]</a></span> Most of all he liked
a bit of something that was covered with a white coating, which looked a
good deal like snow. But it did not taste like snow at all; it was as
sweet as sweet could be!</p>

<p>Rusty Red-squirrel found a piece of the same dainty, and he explained to
Frisky that it was called &#8220;cake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ate some once at Farmer Green&#8217;s house,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Farmer Green&#8217;s wife
makes it.&#8221; And Frisky decided on the spot that he would pay a visit to
the farmhouse. It was too late to go that day. But the next morning
Frisky set out for Farmer Green&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>In the distance he could see white smoke curling from the red chimney.
And though he did not know it, that meant that it was baking-day, and
Farmer Green&#8217;s wife was just as busy as she could be, making good things
for her hungry family.<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_25' id='Page_25'>[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>When Frisky Squirrel reached the farmhouse he found the kitchen window
wide open. And after making sure that there was no one inside the room,
he stole in and jumped up on a shelf where there was a row of dishes
with all sorts of tempting things on them.</p>

<p>To Frisky&#8217;s joy, he found a whole cake exactly like the bit he had
discovered in the woods. And he ate all he wanted; there seemed to be no
reason why he shouldn&#8217;t, there was so much of it.</p>

<p>And then a door slammed somewhere. The noise startled Frisky Squirrel
and he fell right off the shelf, backwards, and landed plump in the
flour-barrel.</p>

<p>He was nearly smothered. And he was frightened, too. But he managed to
scramble out again. And you should have seen the white streak that went
shooting across the kitchen floor, out the door, and<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_26' id='Page_26'>[Pg 26]</a></span> away. It was
Frisky Squirrel, of course, covered with flour. He never stopped running
until he was half-way home. And then he climbed a tree and sat down to
lick himself clean again. To his astonishment, he found that the white
powder that covered him tasted very good. It reminded him of wheat. And
that is not surprising, since the flour was made of wheat which Farmer
Green had grown in his own fields, and which had been ground into flour
by the miller who lived further up Swift River.</p>

<p>Though the flour tasted good, Frisky did not like it as well as the
cake. He wished he had been covered with that sweet, snowlike frosting.</p>

<h2>V</h2><h3>Some Lively Dodging</h3>
</div>

<p>Frisky Squirrel was having his usual fun, leaping through the tree-tops.
He went skipping and scrambling among the boughs as if a hundred jays
were after him. But they were only make-believe enemies. And after a
while Frisky grew tired of playing all alone. He wished he could find
Jasper Jay again. He would have liked to tease the rude fellow, until
Jasper chased him.</p>

<p>As Frisky paused for a moment to catch his breath he heard a long-drawn,
squealing whistle, somewhat like the sound of escaping steam.<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_28' id='Page_28'>[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Jasper Jay right now!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;And he&#8217;s trying to make
people think he&#8217;s a red-tailed hawk. But he can&#8217;t fool me that way. I&#8217;ll
just go and find him. And then maybe I won&#8217;t tease him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Frisky started toward the place where he had heard that whistle. He
called to Jasper Jay; but there was no answer. Nor did he hear the
whistle again. He hunted all around; but no Jasper Jay could he find.
And he was just going to give up the search when there was a sudden rush
through the air.</p>

<p>Frisky dodged just in time; and a big body, grayish-brown, with a
rusty-red tail, went tearing past him. He had been mistaken. It wasn&#8217;t
Jasper Jay he had heard whistling, but this fierce red-tailed hawk. Here
was even more fun than Frisky had hoped for!<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_29' id='Page_29'>[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p>As soon as Mr. Hawk could stop his swift flight he turned and came back
again. And there followed the liveliest sort of dodging for Frisky
Squirrel. It was well for him that he had had plenty of practice all the
spring, or I am afraid he would never have escaped.</p>

<p>He was not afraid. And now and then he laughed at Mr. Hawk. And now and
then he shouted &#8220;Robber!&#8221; at him, and &#8220;Thief!&#8221; And he asked him how many
of Farmer Green&#8217;s chickens he had stolen lately.</p>

<p>But Mr. Hawk never once answered&mdash;except to whistle sometimes as he went
sailing past. He paid strict attention to what he was doing. And he
seemed to have no idea of stopping until he got Frisky Squirrel in his
claws.</p>

<p>After a while Frisky began to tire of the sport. But not Mr. Hawk! He
kept flying<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_30' id='Page_30'>[Pg 30]</a></span> back and forth, back and forth, past Frisky. And his cruel
eyes glared terribly every time he came near.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better go along home,&#8221; Frisky called to him. &#8220;You can never catch
me, if you try till snow flies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Hawk lighted on a near-by tree and looked at Frisky. Frisky was a
plump little squirrel and Mr. Hawk hated to give him up. But as he
thought the matter over he seemed to decide that Frisky was a little too
spry for him. And with one more whistle he mounted up above the trees
and sailed calmly away.</p>

<p>Frisky Squirrel went home then; and he told his mother what sport he had
had, and how Mr. Hawk had at last flown away in despair. &#8220;I hope he&#8217;ll
come back again to-morrow,&#8221; said Frisky.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Squirrel shook her head. She wished that Frisky was less
daring.</p>

<h2>VI</h2><h3>Mr. Hawk Returns</h3>
</div>

<p>After he escaped from the fierce red-tailed hawk you would naturally
think that Frisky Squirrel would have been glad to keep away from such a
great, strong enemy. But the very next day found Frisky searching
everywhere for that cruel, hook-nosed Mr. Hawk. He wanted more of that
fine sport that he had had the day before, dodging and twisting around
the limbs of the trees, while Mr. Hawk swooped down and tried to seize
him. There was another reason, too, why Frisky wanted to find Mr. Hawk
again&mdash;and that was because he knew that it annoyed Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_32' id='Page_32'>[Pg 32]</a></span> Hawk very much
not to be able to catch him. You see, Frisky Squirrel was a great tease.</p>

<p>Well, as I said, Frisky hunted all through the woods for the red-tailed
hawk. But he couldn&#8217;t find him. There was a good reason why&mdash;and that
was because Mr. Hawk was waiting for Frisky in the top of a tree near
Mrs. Squirrel&#8217;s home. He was waiting and watching&mdash;was Mr. Hawk. When
Frisky had given up his search and was almost home he heard the smaller
birds warning one another of the danger, telling of the savage old
fellow who was half-hidden on a high branch of the tall elm. Frisky
first heard a flicker calling to a towhee; and the towhee told a robin;
and the robin told a little song sparrow that he had better keep out of
sight unless he wanted Mr. Hawk to catch him. You may be sure that the
little song sparrow<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_33' id='Page_33'>[Pg 33]</a></span> was very careful after that. He gave a few <i>chips</i>,
just to do his share in warning the other forest-people to look out for
the red-tailed hawk; and then he crept into a thicket and kept just as
still as a mouse.</p>

<p>When Frisky heard the news&mdash;for he knew what the birds were telling one
another&mdash;he hurried along joyfully. <i>He</i> was not afraid of Mr. Hawk. Mr.
Hawk was the very person he was looking for.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, you old ruffian!&#8221; Frisky called, as soon as he spied Mr. Hawk.
It certainly was a very impolite thing to say, even if it <i>was</i> true.</p>

<p>Mr. Hawk turned his cruel eyes upon Frisky Squirrel and then he dashed
toward him as fast as he knew how. He dropped down like lightning from
his high perch, and Frisky had to dodge quickly to escape him; but that
was part of the fun.<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_34' id='Page_34'>[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>Frisky Squirrel laughed as Mr. Hawk went sailing by him. And then
something happened&mdash;something Frisky was not expecting. He heard a rush
through the air, and a nervous little wren screamed to him to look out.
Frisky didn&#8217;t know what the trouble was; but he gave a great leap to one
side.</p>

<p>He was just in time. He had hardly left the limb to which he had been
clinging when Mr. Hawk&#8217;s wife went coursing past. You see, Mr. Hawk had
made up his mind that he was going to catch Frisky Squirrel, even if he
had to bring Mrs. Hawk along to help him.</p>

<h2>VII</h2><h3>A Brave Little Bird</h3>
</div>

<p>It was not long before Frisky Squirrel began to see that he had got
himself into something very like a fix. It had been fairly easy to dodge
Mr. Hawk alone. But things were quite different now. Mr. Hawk would come
hurtling down upon him from one direction; and Mrs. Hawk would swoop
down upon him from another. It was all very confusing, because Frisky
could not watch both of them at once.</p>

<p>He called to his mother, because he began to be frightened. But Mrs.
Squirrel was not at home. Frisky did not know what to do. He tried to
reach his home in<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_36' id='Page_36'>[Pg 36]</a></span> the big hickory tree near-by; but Mr. and Mrs. Hawk
wouldn&#8217;t let him go near it. And when he felt one of Mr. Hawk&#8217;s sharp
talons dig into his back Frisky thought that his end had come. But he
escaped that time, though Mrs. Hawk nearly caught him just two seconds
later.</p>

<p>I am afraid <i>The Tale of Frisky Squirrel</i> would have ended right here,
if somebody had not come to Frisky&#8217;s help. Fortunately, there was a
small, olive-green bird who lived with his wife not far from Frisky
Squirrel&#8217;s home. Mr. Kinglet was his name. And though he was a tiny
fellow he had a heart like a lion&#8217;s. I suppose that in all the country
around Blue Mountain there was no braver fellow than he. And his wife
was brave too. Although they both wore very dull-colored clothes, if you
took a good look at Mr. Kinglet you could see that he always wore a
bright<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_37' id='Page_37'>[Pg 37]</a></span> red crown. He was very modest about his crown, and generally
wore it so that only a little of it showed. But whenever he went out to
fight, as the forest-people are often obliged to, that beautiful red
crown might be seen as plain as could be.</p>

<p>Now, it happened that Mrs. Kinglet heard Mr. and Mrs. Hawk talking to
each other, as they tried to capture Frisky Squirrel, and she heard the
other forest-people shouting, too. So she called to Mr. Kinglet that
somebody seemed to be in trouble; and he came hurrying up at once.</p>

<p>When the little frightened wren screamed, Mr. Kinglet made up his mind
that it was time for him to do something. And he pushed his red crown up
on the top of his head where it would show better and he flew straight
toward Mr. Hawk.</p>

<p>Mr. Kinglet flew up over Mr. Hawk&#8217;s<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_38' id='Page_38'>[Pg 38]</a></span> head, and then he darted down and
lighted right in the middle of Mr. Hawk&#8217;s broad back, and began pecking
him as hard as he could with his sharp little bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Hawk stopped trying to catch Frisky. He had all he wanted to do to
shake that bold little fellow off his back. And though Mrs. Hawk still
swooped down at Frisky Squirrel, brave Mr. Kinglet&#8217;s brave little wife
began to fly at <i>her</i> so fiercely that Mrs. Hawk couldn&#8217;t keep Frisky
from reaching the tree where he lived.</p>

<p>He was very glad to get home, you may be sure. And he dived in through
the door and was out of sight in no time. But pretty soon he stuck his
head out again to see what was happening. Mr. and Mrs. Hawk had
vanished. And all the forest-people were thanking Mr. and Mrs. Kinglet
for driving them away. Frisky<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_39' id='Page_39'>[Pg 39]</a></span> Squirrel thanked them, too. And when he
remembered how he had sometimes teased Mrs. Kinglet by visiting her nest
he felt very much ashamed, and he promised himself that he would never
trouble her again.</p>

<h2>VIII</h2><h3>Uncle Sammy Coon</h3>
</div>

<p>One day Frisky Squirrel was looking for something to eat in the woods,
when whom should he meet but Uncle Sammy Coon, a good-for-nothing old
fellow who lived over in the swamp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, young man!&#8221; said Uncle Sammy, &#8220;what are you doing here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to find a few seeds to eat,&#8221; Frisky explained.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know where there&#8217;s some corn,&#8221; said Uncle Sammy Coon. &#8220;It&#8217;s last
year&#8217;s corn, to be sure; but it&#8217;s good, just the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is it?&#8221; Frisky asked him.<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_41' id='Page_41'>[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Hm&mdash;&#8221; said Uncle Sammy. &#8220;If I told you would you get some of it for me?
It would be easy for a spry young chap like you to take all you wanted
of it. But I&#8217;ve a lame knee, you know, and I can&#8217;t climb so well as I
used to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I&#8217;ll get some corn for you,&#8221; Frisky promised. &#8220;Where is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take you to it,&#8221; said Uncle Sammy&mdash;&#8220;this very night.&#8221; He was a
suspicious old chap&mdash;which means that he was afraid that if he told
Frisky then, Frisky would go off alone and take what corn he wanted
without giving Uncle Sammy any.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-night!&#8221; Frisky exclaimed. &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t stay out late at night, you
know, as you do.&#8221; Uncle Sammy Coon was known to keep very late hours.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&mdash;right after sundown, then,&#8221; the old rascal said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll meet over
by the<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_42' id='Page_42'>[Pg 42]</a></span> brook. Don&#8217;t tell your mother. It will be a pleasant surprise
for her, when you bring home a fine bagful of corn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right! I&#8217;ll be there,&#8221; Frisky told him.</p>

<p>And sure enough! Just as the sun sank out of sight that evening, Frisky
appeared on the bank of the brook. And he hadn&#8217;t told his mother what he
was going to do, either.</p>

<p>Pretty soon Uncle Sammy Coon came along. He had an old sack slung over
his shoulder and a wide grin on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, young man!&#8221; he said, &#8220;and we&#8217;ll go over to Farmer Green&#8217;s
place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Farmer Green&#8217;s!&#8221; Frisky cried. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to go there.&#8221; He
remembered the fright he had had when he fell into the flour-barrel in
Farmer Green&#8217;s kitchen.</p>

<p>&#8220;You promised,&#8221; Uncle Sammy reminded him. &#8220;And unless you want<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_43' id='Page_43'>[Pg 43]</a></span>
something you won&#8217;t like nearly so well as corn, you had better march
right along with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was so cross that Frisky Squirrel thought he had better mind him. But
Frisky wished he had not come. And he wished he had told his mother what
he was going to do, too. But he trotted along with Uncle Sammy&mdash;only he
was careful not to get too close to the tricky old gentleman, for there
was no knowing when Uncle Sammy might suddenly decide that he would
rather have a nice, tender, young gray squirrel to eat than all the last
year&#8217;s corn in the world. You see, the little forest-people have to
think of many things&mdash;especially when they walk out alone with a person
like Uncle Sammy Coon.</p>

<h2>IX</h2><h3>A Bag of Corn</h3>
</div>

<p>When Frisky Squirrel and Uncle Sammy Coon arrived at Farmer Green&#8217;s
place, the moon was just rising. It wasn&#8217;t dark, but Uncle Sammy said
that they would have no trouble at all, because Farmer Green&#8217;s family
would be in the house, eating their evening meal.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the corn-house,&#8221; he said, pointing to an old stone building.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a hole in the wall up there under the roof. All you have to do
is to climb that tree, run out on that limb, crawl through the hole, and
there you are&mdash;inside. Then you can bring the corn up to<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_45' id='Page_45'>[Pg 45]</a></span> the hole, drop
it out onto the ground, and I&#8217;ll stay outside and pick it up and put it
in this sack and watch out for old dog Spot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;I&#8217;ll be doing most of the work, for I&#8217;ll be
doing three things, while all you&#8217;ll have to do will be to drop the corn
out of the hole in the wall.... But I don&#8217;t mind doing more than my
share.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frisky Squirrel couldn&#8217;t quite understand how Uncle Sammy would be doing
most of the work. But since the old gentleman said it was so, Frisky
supposed it was the truth. There was one thing, however, that puzzled
him still more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you brought a bag for my share of the corn?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ll divide this bagful,&#8221; said Uncle Sammy. &#8220;When we get over the
hill we&#8217;ll sit down and divide it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; said Frisky. And then he<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_46' id='Page_46'>[Pg 46]</a></span> hurried up the tree. In no more
than a jiffy he was inside the old stone building; and pretty soon the
corn began to patter, patter, down upon the ground where Uncle Sammy
waited.</p>

<p>Frisky had been working steadily for some time. And he began to wonder
if the bag was not full. He thought he would just peep out of the hole
in the wall and see. So he stuck his head out. To his surprise, Uncle
Sammy had vanished. And as Frisky looked all around he caught sight of
Uncle Sammy Coon with the bag of corn on his back, hurrying up the road.
For an old gentleman with a lame knee he was going at a very fast pace.</p>

<p>Frisky Squirrel wondered why he had run away. But he didn&#8217;t wonder long,
for a dog barked; and the bark came from right underneath the hole in
the wall. Then Farmer Green came running up the<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_47' id='Page_47'>[Pg 47]</a></span> path which led to the
corn-house. He had a gun in his hand, too.</p>

<p>Frisky didn&#8217;t wait to see anything more. He whisked out of the hole, and
climbed the roof, and jumped into another tree on the other side of the
corn-house. And soon he too was running like mad along the road&mdash;only he
was going in exactly the opposite direction to that in which Uncle Sammy
had vanished.</p>

<p>He never stopped running until he had reached the woods. And since he
could not bring any corn home with him, he thought that there was really
no sense in telling his mother anything about his adventure.</p>

<p>The next day, as Frisky was playing in a tree-top, he came across Uncle
Sammy Coon sunning himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s my corn?&#8221; asked Frisky Squirrel.<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_48' id='Page_48'>[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Corn!&#8221; Uncle Sammy exclaimed, as if he had forgotten all about such a
thing. &#8220;Oh! you mean that corn that we got last night. Now, I&#8217;m sorry to
say that the bag was so heavy I had to drop it, because old dog Spot was
after me, you know. And when I went back to get it, later, it wasn&#8217;t
there.... We&#8217;ll have to try again, some other time,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Frisky Squirrel began to see that the old fellow had tricked him. Uncle
Sammy&#8217;s sides looked very plump, as if he had had an unusually good
meal. And he smiled so pleasantly that Frisky Squirrel became very
angry.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get your own corn next time,&#8221; he snapped. And as he skipped away
he heard Uncle Sammy Coon laugh heartily&mdash;just as though something had
amused him.</p>

<p>Among all his friends, Frisky Squirrel liked to play with Jimmy Rabbit
best. You see, Jimmy never wanted to eat him. He was so fond of tender
young sprouts, and of Farmer Green&#8217;s vegetables, that he wouldn&#8217;t have
taken even the smallest bite out of Frisky. He would have laughed at the
very idea.</p>

<p>There was something else, too, about Jimmy Rabbit, that Frisky Squirrel
liked; he was always thinking of new things to do&mdash;new places to visit,
new games, new tricks to play on other forest-people.</p>

<p>To be sure, Jimmy and Frisky did not<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_50' id='Page_50'>[Pg 50]</a></span> always agree&mdash;but that is not
surprising, because their tastes were so different. For instance, there
was nothing that Frisky Squirrel liked better than a hickory nut, while
Jimmy Rabbit never would so much as touch one. But if anybody said
&#8220;cabbage&#8221; to Jimmy Rabbit he would have to stop playing and hurry to
Farmer Green&#8217;s garden. You see how fond of cabbage Jimmy was.</p>

<p>There were other things, too, on which Frisky and Jimmy held different
views. They were forever disputing about ears and tails. Frisky
Squirrel, as you know, had a beautiful, long, bushy tail, and short
little ears; while Jimmy Rabbit had ears half as long as he was, and
almost no tail at all!</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Frisky, you ought to have that tail of yours cut off,&#8221; Jimmy
said one day. &#8220;It&#8217;s terribly out of fashion to wear a tail<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_51' id='Page_51'>[Pg 51]</a></span> so long as
yours. As a special favor, I&#8217;ll be willing to cut it off for you, with a
big pair of shears that my mother has.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frisky Squirrel was just a bit angry at this remark about his tail.</p>

<p>&#8220;What about your ears?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Not one of the forest-people&mdash;except
rabbits&mdash;wears his ears so long as you do. I must say that they look
very queer. How&#8217;d you like to have me trim them for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell you what we&#8217;ll do,&#8221; Jimmy Rabbit said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll cut off your tail and
you&#8217;ll cut off my ears. What do you say?&#8221;</p>

<p>Somehow or other, Frisky did not quite like the idea of losing his tail.
He was so used to having it that he was afraid he might miss it
dreadfully. And he even thought that he would rather keep it&mdash;even if it
<i>was</i> out of fashion.</p>

<p>But Jimmy Rabbit ran home to get his<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_52' id='Page_52'>[Pg 52]</a></span> mother&#8217;s shears. And when he came
back with them Frisky couldn&#8217;t think of any good excuse for not letting
Jimmy cut off his tail for him. As Jimmy came hopping up with the
shears, Frisky Squirrel put out his paw.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want?&#8221; asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>&#8220;The shears!&#8221; Frisky said. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to trim your ears, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;yes!&#8221; Jimmy answered. &#8220;But I thought of this <i>first</i>, you remember.
So I&#8217;ll cut your tail off first. Then you&#8217;ll have your turn&mdash;see?&#8221; He
kept a firm hold on the shears. And almost before Frisky knew what was
happening Jimmy had stepped behind him and had placed Frisky&#8217;s tail
between the big shears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will it hurt?&#8221; Frisky asked, as he looked behind him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll all be over in a jiffy,&#8221; said Jimmy Rabbit.</p>

<h2>XI</h2><h3>Jimmy Rabbit is too Late</h3>
</div>

<p>It was just as Jimmy Rabbit had said. You remember that as he stood
behind Frisky Squirrel&#8217;s back with his mother&#8217;s big shears, all ready to
cut off Frisky&#8217;s tail, he had told Frisky that &#8220;it would all be over in
a jiffy&#8221;?</p>

<p>Well, it <i>was</i>. But things didn&#8217;t happen just as Jimmy Rabbit had
expected. He had taken a good, firm grip on the shears, and he was just
about to shut them upon Frisky&#8217;s tail with a snap, when somebody called
Frisky&#8217;s name. Frisky knew who it was right away. It was his mother! And
like most of us, when our mothers<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_54' id='Page_54'>[Pg 54]</a></span> catch us doing something we ought not
to do, Frisky was so surprised and so startled that he gave a great
jump.</p>

<p>That jump was all that saved Frisky&#8217;s tail. For just as Mrs. Squirrel
called, Jimmy Rabbit shut the shears together as hard as he could. But
Jimmy was too late. When Frisky jumped, his tail followed him, of
course. It whisked out from between the shears; and they closed upon
nothing at all.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, that&#8217;s too bad!&#8221; Jimmy exclaimed. He had been so interested in
what he was doing that he had never heard Mrs. Squirrel at all. &#8220;Come
back here and we&#8217;ll try again.&#8221;</p>

<p>The words were scarcely out of Jimmy Rabbit&#8217;s mouth when he received a
terrific box on the ear. Now, it&#8217;s bad enough for anybody to have his
ears boxed. But Jimmy&#8217;s ears were so big that I dare say it<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_55' id='Page_55'>[Pg 55]</a></span> hurt him
three times as much as it would have hurt anyone else. And it surprised
him, too. For he hadn&#8217;t heard Mrs. Squirrel as she stole up behind him.
Anyhow, he ran off howling, taking his mother&#8217;s shears with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;That awful Rabbit boy!&#8221; Mrs. Squirrel said. &#8220;A moment more and he would
have cut off your beautiful tail&mdash;your best feature, too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s a feature, Mother?&#8221; Frisky asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;your nose, and your eyes, and your ears&mdash;anything of that sort,&#8221;
Mrs. Squirrel said. &#8220;It makes me feel faint just to think what almost
happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Jimmy Rabbit says long tails are out of fashion,&#8221; said Frisky.</p>

<p>&#8220;Out of fashion indeed!&#8221; Mrs. Squirrel sniffed. &#8220;He&#8217;s jealous&mdash;that&#8217;s
what&#8217;s the trouble with him. He wishes he had a<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_56' id='Page_56'>[Pg 56]</a></span> fine, long, bushy tail
himself. Goodness me! I&#8217;m all of a flutter&mdash;I&#8217;m so upset.&#8221; And poor Mrs.
Squirrel sat right down and fanned herself with her sun-bonnet. &#8220;Now,
don&#8217;t you ever let anybody try to cut off your tail again,&#8221; she said to
Frisky. &#8220;You have your father&#8217;s tail. And everybody always said that he
had the most beautiful tail that was ever seen in these woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frisky didn&#8217;t quite understand what his mother meant. If he had his
father&#8217;s tail, then where was his? And if it was his, then where was his
father&#8217;s? All the way home he kept asking himself questions like those.
But whatever the answers might be, Frisky was glad that he still bore
that beautiful brush. He began to see that he would have looked very
queer, with just a short stub like Jimmy Rabbit&#8217;s.</p>

<h2>XII</h2><h3>Frisky Visits the Gristmill</h3>
</div>

<p>Frisky Squirrel was very fond of wheat-kernels. Somehow or other he
heard that there was a place on Swift River called the gristmill, where
there was almost all the wheat in the world&mdash;at least that is what
Frisky heard. So he started out, one day, to find the gristmill. He
thought he could have a very pleasant time there.</p>

<p>Frisky had no trouble at all in finding the gristmill. It was just below
the mill-dam. And everybody knew where that was.</p>

<p>The gristmill was an old stone building<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_58' id='Page_58'>[Pg 58]</a></span> with a red roof. And once
inside it Frisky saw great heaps of wheat-kernels everywhere. And there
were sacks and sacks too&mdash;some of them stuffed with kernels, which
Frisky was so fond of, and some of them filled with a fine white powder,
which Frisky didn&#8217;t like so well, because it got in his eyes, and up his
nose, and made him sneeze. It was the same sort of powder into which he
had fallen one time at Farmer Green&#8217;s house. It was flour, of
course&mdash;you must have guessed that.</p>

<p>The gristmill was a quiet sort of building. There seemed to be nobody
there at all. And Frisky helped himself freely to wheat-kernels, for it
was very early in the morning and he had not had his breakfast. He was
just telling himself what a delightful place the gristmill was, and how
glad he was that he had heard about it, when<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_59' id='Page_59'>[Pg 59]</a></span> suddenly there was a
terrible noise&mdash;a grinding, and whirring, and buzzing, and pounding. The
very floor trembled and shook, and Frisky expected that in another
instant the roof would come crashing down on him.</p>

<p>He leaped away from the bag of wheat-kernels on which he had been
breakfasting and he bounded through the great doorway and ran along the
rail-fence, far up the road, thinking that each moment would be his
last. For Frisky believed that the end of the world had come. And he
never stopped running until he was safe inside his mother&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>Mrs. Squirrel was not at home. And it was so long before she came in and
found Frisky that he had begun to think he would never see her again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whatever is the matter?&#8221; Mrs. Squirrel asked. Frisky was making a<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_60' id='Page_60'>[Pg 60]</a></span>
dreadful noise, for he was crying as if he would never stop.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the end of the world!&#8221; Frisky sobbed. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t think you were
coming back.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bit by bit Mrs. Squirrel managed to learn where Frisky had been and what
had happened to him. And she smiled when she found out what had
frightened him. Since it was quite dark inside their home in the hollow
limb of the big hickory tree, Frisky could not see his mother smiling.
But her voice sounded very cheerful when she said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now stop crying, my son. There&#8217;s nothing to cry about. The end of the
world hasn&#8217;t come. And <i>that&#8217;s</i> something you and I don&#8217;t need to worry
about, anyhow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What you heard was only the mill-wheels turning. You must have reached<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_61' id='Page_61'>[Pg 61]</a></span>
the gristmill before the miller had come to begin his day&#8217;s work. That
was why everything was so still. I don&#8217;t wonder you were frightened when
all that noise began. But gristmills are always like that. They make a
terrible noise when they grind the wheat.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frisky Squirrel stopped sobbing then. He was glad that his mother knew
exactly what had happened. But he made up his mind that whenever he
wanted any wheat-kernels to eat he would not go to the gristmill for
them. Luckily the gristmill had not <i>quite</i> all the wheat in the world.</p>

<h2>XIII</h2><h3>Fun on the Milldam</h3>
</div>

<p>There was something about the dam across Swift River that Frisky
Squirrel simply couldn&#8217;t keep away from&mdash;after he had forgotten,
somewhat, his fright at the gristmill. Only a few days passed after
Frisky had run home from the mill in a panic, before he was back again.
He liked to run across the top of the dam and look down at his
reflection in the water on one side. Here and there a narrow stream
spilled over the top of the dam. Frisky felt very brave as he leaped
over those little rivulets. And he loved to watch them as they fell in
thin, silvery<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_63' id='Page_63'>[Pg 63]</a></span> cascades upon the rocks far below. It was great sport.</p>

<p>One day when Frisky reached the dam he heard a dog bark not far away. It
was the miller&#8217;s dog. He had seen Frisky as he crossed the road. And he
at once hurried toward him.</p>

<p>Frisky Squirrel was annoyed. He had just been thinking what a good time
he was going to have. But when that dog started to bark Frisky knew that
his fun was spoiled. He wasn&#8217;t frightened. Oh, no! But he was sure that
the dog would not go away until <i>he</i> did.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll just take one run across the dam,&#8221; Frisky said to himself.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll stay on the other side of the river until he grows tired of
waiting. And then I&#8217;ll come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hurried on to the bank of the river; and in a few moments he was
skipping<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_64' id='Page_64'>[Pg 64]</a></span> along the dam. The dog was still barking. And Frisky looked
around at him. To his great surprise, there was the dog following him,
right along the top of the dam. But even then Frisky was not frightened.
He simply hurried a little faster. He had not dreamed that the miller&#8217;s
dog would chase him across Swift River. But there he was. And he was
running fast, too.</p>

<p>Then something happened that really frightened Frisky Squirrel. At first
he could hardly believe it. But it was true. It really was another dog
that was barking&mdash;another dog that was waiting on the other side of
Swift River. And almost as soon as Frisky saw him, that other dog
started right across the dam, to meet Frisky!</p>


<div class='figcenter' style='width: 300px; padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em;'>
<a name='illus-024' id='illus-024'></a>
<img src='images/illus-047.png' alt='' title='' /><br />
<span class='caption'>Fun on the mill dam</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_65' id='Page_65'>[Pg 65]</a></span>There was no time to lose. Frisky had to make up his mind very quickly.
He gave just one look at the deep mill pond. He could swim&mdash;if he had
to. But he just hated to get wet. And he knew that the dogs were much
faster swimmers than he was. So he looked away from the water with a
shudder. And he peeped over the steep side of the dam and gazed at the
rocks below, where the water splashed into countless drops.</p>

<p>Those rocks were a long way beneath him. But there was one thing about
Frisky Squirrel&mdash;he never was the least bit dizzy, or afraid, when he
looked down from high places. Perhaps there were too many other things
to be afraid of&mdash;such as coons and foxes&mdash;and dogs.</p>

<p>The miller&#8217;s dog was drawing nearer now, because Frisky had stopped. And
the dog from the other side of the river was only about six jumps away!</p>

<p>Frisky Squirrel didn&#8217;t wait another instant.<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_66' id='Page_66'>[Pg 66]</a></span> He jumped right down the
face of the dam. Where he had stood a moment before the two dogs came
together with a bump. Probably they would have started to fight, if they
had not been so interested in Frisky Squirrel. There they stood, with
their necks stretched out over the edge of the dam, watching Frisky as
he went rolling and tumbling down to the bed of the river. And when they
saw him pick himself up and go skipping from stone to stone until he
reached the shore and scampered away, they looked very foolish indeed.</p>

<p>In fact, they felt foolish, too. And without saying one word they turned
about and each crept back to his own side of Swift River.</p>

<h2>XIV</h2><h3>Mrs. Squirrel Has a Visitor</h3>
</div>

<p>Fatty Coon was very hungry. And he stole along through the woods very
quietly, hoping to find something to eat. To his great joy, it was not
long before he discovered Mrs. Squirrel&#8217;s home. He crept up to the nest
silently; for he hoped to catch Mrs. Squirrel and Frisky inside. But
Mrs. Squirrel and her son were both away.</p>

<p>Fatty was disappointed. But he made up his mind to go into the house
anyhow, to see what he could find there. So he pushed through the narrow
doorway. It was a tight squeeze; but Fatty managed<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_68' id='Page_68'>[Pg 68]</a></span> to get inside. And
there he found a fine lot of beechnuts, which Mrs. Squirrel had brought
home and stored, in order to have something to eat during the winter.</p>

<p>Fatty Coon just loved beechnuts. And he squatted down on the floor and
began to eat. He ate and ate until he was half-buried in
beechnut-shells. And he never stopped until he had finished the very
last beechnut. He wished there had been more, though you would think he
had had quite enough, for Fatty&#8217;s sides bulged out so that he was
rounder than ever. He smiled as he thought of the surprise Mrs. Squirrel
would have when she came home and found her winter food all gone. And
then he stood up, shook the shells out of his coat, and started to climb
through the doorway.</p>

<p>Fatty was still smiling as he stuck his head through the opening in the
tree. But<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_69' id='Page_69'>[Pg 69]</a></span> all at once his smile faded away. You remember that he had
had hard work to squeeze through the narrow doorway when he entered the
house? Well, now his sides stuck out so far that he couldn&#8217;t get through
it at all. He tried and tried; but though he struggled hard, Fatty found
that he simply could not squeeze through. He had stuffed himself so full
of beechnuts that he was too big to get out of the hole. And there he
was&mdash;caught fast by his own greediness! Yes! Fatty Coon was a prisoner.</p>

<p>Fatty had smiled because he thought Mrs. Squirrel would be surprised
when she came home. And he had not been mistaken about that. When Mrs.
Squirrel and her son Frisky scampered up the tree about sundown that
evening they had the surprise of their lives&mdash;though not just the sort
of surprise Fatty had expected.<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_70' id='Page_70'>[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>They looked in through their doorway and scolded. And they ordered Fatty
to get out of their house at once.</p>

<p>He would have been glad enough to leave, you may be sure. But he
couldn&#8217;t go just then. And at last Frisky Squirrel and his mother had to
go and spend the night in the house of a friend.</p>

<p>When they came back to the old hickory tree the next morning Fatty Coon
had gone. He had tried the whole night long to get through the doorway.
And at last&mdash;just as the sun was rising&mdash;he managed to slip out.</p>

<p>Mrs. Squirrel knew that Fatty had had a hard time, because he had left a
good deal of his fur behind him. It clung to the sides of the doorway.
And Mrs. Squirrel spent half the day picking it off and throwing the
beechnut-shells out of her house. She was a very neat housekeeper;<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_71' id='Page_71'>[Pg 71]</a></span> and
she was quite annoyed to find her house upset.</p>

<p>As for Frisky, he began to bring home another store of nuts that very
day. After what had happened neither he nor his mother had any fear that
Fatty Coon would ever trouble them again.</p>

<h2>XV</h2><h3>Helpful Mr. Crow</h3>
</div>

<p>Frisky Squirrel&#8217;s mother had often told him not to have anything to do
with Mr. Crow. &#8220;He&#8217;s such a tricky old fellow!&#8221; she said. &#8220;He seems to
have nothing to do but get folks into trouble. Don&#8217;t go near him, and
don&#8217;t have anything to say to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, I&#8217;m sure Frisky Squirrel wanted to mind his mother. But he couldn&#8217;t
help feeling that she was mistaken about Mr. Crow. He was so solemn, and
he always looked so like a preacher&mdash;for he usually wore shiny, black
clothes&mdash;that Frisky Squirrel thought him a very nice old<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_73' id='Page_73'>[Pg 73]</a></span> gentleman.
And he told such interesting stories, too! Frisky could listen to him by
the hour.</p>

<p>So, in spite of his mother&#8217;s warnings, whenever he met Mr. Crow Frisky
Squirrel would always stop and ask the old gentleman how his cold was.
You see, Mr. Crow&#8217;s voice was never what you would call <i>clear</i>. You
might say that there was a decided croak in it. And very often, even on
hot summer days, he would have a muffler wound about his throat.</p>

<p>It happened that one day when Frisky came across Mr. Crow in the woods,
something reminded Mr. Crow that he knew where there were plenty of
butternuts&mdash;just waiting to be eaten.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; Frisky exclaimed. &#8220;Have you had some of them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! I don&#8217;t care for butternuts,&#8221; Mr. Crow said, with a slight cough.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve always<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_74' id='Page_74'>[Pg 74]</a></span> considered them bad for my throat. I&#8217;ve made it a rule
never to eat them. You don&#8217;t happen to like them, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, if there was one thing that Frisky Squirrel liked a little better
than anything else, it was butternuts. And when he answered Mr. Crow&#8217;s
question he was so excited that his voice shook just the least bit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m <i>very</i> fond of them,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well!&#8221; Mr. Crow exclaimed. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad I happened to mention the
matter. They&#8217;re there&mdash;heaps of &#8217;em&mdash;great brown piles of &#8217;em&mdash;thousands
of &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Where</i> are they?&#8221; Frisky asked him eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh&mdash;I thought I told you,&#8221; Mr. Crow said. &#8220;Why&mdash;they&#8217;re in Farmer
Green&#8217;s attic. His boy put them up there to dry. I saw them through the
window, this very day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frisky Squirrel was disappointed.<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_75' id='Page_75'>[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I mustn&#8217;t go to Farmer Green&#8217;s house,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! Why not?&#8221; asked Mr. Crow.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t safe. I went there once to get some cake, and I nearly lost my
life in the kitchen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! But this is different,&#8221; Mr. Crow explained. &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to go
into the kitchen at all. All you have to do is to climb that big tree
close by the house. And you can hop right through the attic window.
There&#8217;s nobody upstairs in the daytime. In fact, I should call it one of
the safest places to go that I know of.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Mr. Crow said that, Frisky believed him. Mr. Crow was so old, and
so wise, and so solemn, that Frisky thought that anything he said must
be true.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going past Farmer Green&#8217;s house right now,&#8221; Mr. Crow told Frisky.
&#8220;I have a little matter to attend to over in the<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_76' id='Page_76'>[Pg 76]</a></span> cornfield. And if you
want to come along with me I don&#8217;t mind stopping to show you where the
butternuts are. But of course if you&#8217;re afraid&mdash;&#8221; Mr. Crow stopped to
cough. He buttoned his coat closer around his throat. And then he looked
sideways at Frisky Squirrel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Afraid!&#8221; Frisky exclaimed. &#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said Mr. Crow. &#8220;Now, then, young fellow! You skip along over to
Farmer Green&#8217;s and I&#8217;ll be waiting for you down the road a bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Old Mr. Crow flapped himself away then. And Frisky Squirrel hurried off
in a straight line for the farmhouse.</p>

<h2>XVI</h2><h3>Caught in the Attic</h3>
</div>

<p>Long before Frisky Squirrel reached Farmer Green&#8217;s place, he began to
worry for fear Mr. Crow had grown tired of waiting for him. To be sure,
he knew that the butternuts were up in the attic. But to tell the truth,
Frisky felt uneasy about visiting the farmhouse. And he hoped that Mr.
Crow would show him just how to get through the attic window, as he had
promised.</p>

<p>Just as he came in sight of the farmhouse Frisky heard Mr. Crow calling
to him from a tall tree close by the road. He was glad to hear the old
gentleman&#8217;s husky<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_78' id='Page_78'>[Pg 78]</a></span> voice. And he couldn&#8217;t help thinking how kind Mr.
Crow was, and how mistaken his mother had been to believe that Mr. Crow
liked to get folks into trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; said Mr. Crow, as Frisky paused beneath the tall tree. &#8220;I&#8217;m
going to fly over to that tree right next the farmhouse. You run along
the stone-wall and climb up beside me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, then!&#8221; said Mr. Crow a few minutes later, when Frisky had joined
him. &#8220;There&#8217;s the window&mdash;wide open. And there are the butternuts, lying
on the floor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frisky could see great heaps of nuts. And without another word he crept
out on a limb that brushed the window-sill and in another moment he was
inside Farmer Green&#8217;s attic. Frisky forgot to thank Mr. Crow. He never
once thought of that, he was in such a hurry to taste those nuts.<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_79' id='Page_79'>[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>He just ate and ate and ate; and he was so busy cracking the nuts and
picking out the meats that he never noticed that it was growing dark.</p>

<p>At last, to his astonishment, the attic door opened. Frisky leaped
behind a pile of butternuts and hid, while someone walked across the
floor. Then there was a bang. And Frisky shivered when he heard it. But
the person left the attic at once and went downstairs.</p>

<p>Frisky Squirrel breathed easily again. And he stole out from behind the
pile of nuts. Somehow, he did not care to eat any more. He wanted to get
out of the house. So he went to the window. And then Frisky Squirrel was
really frightened. The window was shut!</p>

<p>You see, while Frisky was so busy eating butternuts, a storm was
gathering. And it grew so dark, and the wind howled<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_80' id='Page_80'>[Pg 80]</a></span> so shrilly, that
Farmer Green&#8217;s wife thought she had better shut the attic window, to
keep the rain from beating in.</p>

<p>How Frisky Squirrel did wish he had minded his mother and kept away from
old Mr. Crow! Poor Frisky looked out through the little square panes of
glass. His friend Mr. Crow was nowhere to be seen. Frisky had hoped that
the old gentleman would be waiting for him, and that since Mr. Crow had
told him how to get inside the attic he would be able to tell him how to
get out again.</p>

<p>The wind swept the branches of the tall tree back and forth across the
window. How easy it would have been&mdash;if the window had been open&mdash;to hop
out upon one of those swaying limbs! Frisky pressed his soft little body
close against the glass and pushed as hard as he could. But he couldn&#8217;t
break out of his prison. It was a<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_81' id='Page_81'>[Pg 81]</a></span> queer thing&mdash;that glass! He could see
through it just as if there was nothing there; and yet it held him fast.
Frisky could not understand it.</p>

<h2>XVII</h2><h3>Farmer Green&#8217;s Cat</h3>
</div>

<p>There were plenty of nuts in the attic of Farmer Green&#8217;s house, where
Frisky Squirrel found himself a prisoner. And you might think that he
wouldn&#8217;t have felt so unhappy to be there. But Frisky was unhappy. He
was so frightened that he crept into a corner and stayed there,
shivering, for a long time. And he couldn&#8217;t have eaten a single one of
those nuts if he had tried. He wanted to be free. He wanted to be out of
doors. He wanted to go home.</p>

<p>After a time the storm passed. The wind stopped blowing. And the sun
shone<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_83' id='Page_83'>[Pg 83]</a></span> again. But nobody came to the attic to open the window. When it
grew quite light Frisky did not feel so frightened. And at last he crept
out of his corner and went nosing about the room, hoping to find a hole
big enough to squeeze through.</p>

<p>Now, you must not think Frisky Squirrel was stupid, when I tell you that
the door was open all this time. It was open just the smallest crack,
for Farmer Green&#8217;s wife hadn&#8217;t quite closed it when she went downstairs.
Frisky had been too frightened to notice it. Besides, the attic had been
dark, you know.</p>

<p>Well, when Frisky found that crack he was the happiest little fellow you
ever saw. It was only a narrow opening; but he slipped through it. And
there he was, right at the head of the stairs! So downstairs he hurried.
The door below was wide open. And in less time than it takes<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_84' id='Page_84'>[Pg 84]</a></span> to tell
the story, Frisky was in Farmer Green&#8217;s kitchen. He remembered that room
very well, for he had been there when he came to taste that
white-frosted cake.</p>

<p>But this time Frisky did not stop to look for any cake. He just
scampered across the floor toward the wide doorway. And as he bounded
across the room something sprang out from behind the stove and started
after him.</p>

<p>Frisky Squirrel saw that some animal had leaped at him. He didn&#8217;t stop
to take a good look; but he supposed that it was a small dog that had
been drying himself by the fire. Frisky knew that dogs couldn&#8217;t climb
trees. So he sprang through the door, never touching the big stone
doorstep at all, and hurried toward a tree in Farmer Green&#8217;s yard. He
laughed as he scurried up the tree-trunk. And then he looked down at his
enemy.<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_85' id='Page_85'>[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Frisky Squirrel&#8217;s heart almost stood still. That small animal was
coming right up the tree after him! Of course, it wasn&#8217;t a dog at all.
It was Farmer Green&#8217;s cat. Frisky had never seen a cat before and he
began to wonder whether the small creature could fly, as well as climb
trees. He scampered to the top of the tree; and then he leaped upon a
branch of another tree close by.</p>

<p>No! The small animal could not fly. She climbed as high as she dared.
And then she stopped. Her eyes glared fiercely; and her tail grew as big
as Frisky&#8217;s own. But that didn&#8217;t help her at all. She could only sit
there and watch Frisky Squirrel as he dropped from branch to branch,
until she lost sight of him among the leaves.</p>

<h2>XVIII</h2><h3>The Threshing-machine</h3>
</div>

<p>One day, late in the summer, Frisky Squirrel saw something that caused
him great excitement. Right into the center of one of Farmer Green&#8217;s
fields he saw Farmer Green&#8217;s horses drag a queer sort of wagon. It was
bigger than any other wagon he had ever seen, and had wheels upon it in
all sorts of strange places, instead of just at the four corners, like
all the wagons he had ever noticed before.</p>

<p>Frisky climbed a tree, in order to get a better view of what was
happening. As he watched, he saw still another odd wagon hauled upon the
field alongside the first one. This wagon carried a broad<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_87' id='Page_87'>[Pg 87]</a></span> walk which
led from the back and went right up what you might call a hill, to the
front of the wagon. And there it stopped, with a wooden bar blocking the
way. Frisky Squirrel thought that that was the strangest path he had
ever seen, for it seemed to lead to nowhere, and why it should have a
bar at the top, to keep anyone from going nowhere at all, was more than
even his lively mind could puzzle out.</p>

<p>In and out and about these strange wagons were as many as a dozen men,
and one boy&mdash;each of them as busy as he could be. And as for the boy,
Johnnie Green, he was busier than anybody else. He seemed to be
everywhere at once, and in everybody&#8217;s way. And Frisky couldn&#8217;t see that
he was doing anything at all. But he noticed that Johnnie appeared to be
having a fine time.<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_88' id='Page_88'>[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>As Frisky Squirrel looked down upon this unusual sight from his perch in
the tree he saw that Farmer Green&#8217;s wagons&mdash;the kind Frisky had often
seen before&mdash;were bringing up sheaves of wheat. And pretty soon&mdash;and
this made Frisky&#8217;s eyes almost pop out of his head&mdash;he saw a man lead a
pair of horses up that short, steep walk and tie them to the bar at the
top of it.</p>

<p>Then the horses began to walk. Now, probably you wouldn&#8217;t think there
was anything strange about that. But there was. The odd thing about that
was that although the horses walked, they didn&#8217;t get anywhere at all. So
far as Frisky Squirrel could see, they just walked and walked, and that
was all there was to it. After they had walked for a long time they
still stayed right in the same place, tied fast to the wooden bar in
front of them.<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_89' id='Page_89'>[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, when the horses were walking, the other wagon began to set up a
great noise. It reminded Frisky of the time the gristmill began to
grind, when he thought the world was coming to an end. Those queer
wheels on the wagon began to turn, too. But Frisky didn&#8217;t pay much
attention to them. What caught his eye and kept him puzzling was those
two horses, always walking, but never going anywhere.</p>

<p>Frisky Squirrel stayed in his tree as long as he could, until at last he
simply had to hurry home and beg his mother to come over to the field
with him.</p>

<p>As it happened, Mrs. Squirrel was not very busy that day, so she dropped
her knitting, or whatever it was that she was doing, and pretty soon she
and Frisky were up in the tree that he had climbed before.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! they&#8217;re threshing!&#8221; Mrs. Squirrel<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_90' id='Page_90'>[Pg 90]</a></span> said, after she had taken one
good look at what was going on. &#8220;They&#8217;re threshing out the
wheat-kernels, so the miller can grind them into flour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But those horses&mdash;&#8221; said Frisky. &#8220;Why is it that they don&#8217;t walk right
against that bar, and break it, and tumble off onto the ground?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a horse-power,&#8221; Mrs. Squirrel explained. &#8220;The path the horses
are treading on moves, and that&#8217;s why they stay right in the same place.
The path moves &#8217;round and &#8217;round all the time, like a broad chain.
That&#8217;s what makes the wheels turn on the threshing-machine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be fun,&#8221; said Frisky Squirrel. &#8220;I wish I could be a horse, and
make that horse-power turn like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; said his mother. &#8220;You&#8217;d soon grow tired of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Frisky Squirrel knew better.</p>

<h2>XIX</h2><h3>Frisky&#8217;s Prison</h3>
</div>

<p>Frisky Squirrel simply couldn&#8217;t keep away from the field where the wheat
was being threshed. He was on hand before the men came in the morning,
and he was the last to leave the place at night. He ate all his meals
right on the spot, and went home only to sleep.</p>

<p>Now, it was not long before Johnnie Green spied Frisky Squirrel
loitering about the field. And he made up his mind that that young
squirrel was altogether too bold. So Johnnie Green rigged up a trap,
which he made from an old box, a few sticks, and a bit of string. And
one noon,<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_92' id='Page_92'>[Pg 92]</a></span> while the men were eating their lunch under some trees a
little way from the threshing-machine, Frisky Squirrel was just reckless
enough to steal up and try to get his luncheon too, by eating some of
the wheat-kernels. He noticed a tempting little heap of kernels, right
beside a little box. And he had just stopped to eat them when all at
once the box toppled over on him, and there he was&mdash;caught!</p>

<p>When Johnnie Green discovered that he had captured that young squirrel
he was just as glad as Frisky was sorry and frightened. That, you see,
is just the difference between <i>catching</i> and <i>being caught</i>. It makes a
great difference whether you are outside the trap, or in it. And Frisky
Squirrel was in it. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn&#8217;t get away.</p>

<p>He made up his mind that if anybody<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_93' id='Page_93'>[Pg 93]</a></span> tried to lift him out of the box he
would bite him. But Johnnie Green had caught squirrels before. He pulled
on a pair of heavy gloves, and all Frisky&#8217;s biting did no good&mdash;or
harm&mdash;at all.</p>

<p>When Johnnie reached home he put his prize into a neat little wire cage.
As soon as Frisky found himself inside it he looked all around, to see
if there wasn&#8217;t some opening big enough to squeeze through. And sure
enough! there was a little door. And in a twinkling Frisky had popped
himself through it and had started to run.</p>

<p>He ran and ran. But strange to say, all his running took him nowhere at
all. At first he couldn&#8217;t discover what was the matter. But after a
while he saw that he was inside a broad wheel, made of wire. And when he
ran the wheel simply spun &#8217;round and &#8217;round.<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_94' id='Page_94'>[Pg 94]</a></span></p>

<p>He stopped running then. For he thought of the horses that made the
horse-power go. He was in just the same fix that they were in. He could
run as fast as he pleased, but he would still stay right there inside
the wheel.</p>

<p>Poor Frisky Squirrel crept back into his cage. He remembered what his
mother had said, when he wished he could be a horse, and make the
tread-mill go. &#8220;You&#8217;d soon grow tired of it,&#8221; she had told him.</p>

<p>At the time, Frisky hadn&#8217;t believed her. But now he knew that his mother
was wiser than he was. And he wondered if he was ever going to see her
again.</p>

<h2>XX</h2><h3>Johnnie Green Forgets Something</h3>
</div>

<p>Although Johnnie Green took good care of Frisky Squirrel, that once
lively young chap did not like his new home in the wire cage at all. His
young master gave him plenty to eat&mdash;nuts and grain&mdash;all the things that
Frisky had always liked before. But now nothing tasted the same. Frisky
never felt really hungry. He just sat in his cage and moped and sulked.</p>

<p>Once in a great while he would go out into his wheel, and run and run
until he was so tired that he was ready to drop. Whenever Johnnie Green
saw him running<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_96' id='Page_96'>[Pg 96]</a></span> inside the wheel that young man would laugh aloud&mdash;he
was so pleased.</p>

<p>But nothing ever pleased Frisky Squirrel any more. He grew peevish and
cross and sulky. Being cooped up in that little wire prison day after
day made an entirely different squirrel of him. He longed to be free
once more&mdash;free to scamper through the tree-tops, and along the
stone-walls and the rail-fences. And at night he dreamed of hunting for
beechnuts, and chestnuts, and hickorynuts, on which he would feast to
his heart&#8217;s content&mdash;in his dreams. But in the daytime, when his young
master put some of those very same nuts into his cage, Frisky would
hardly touch them. He lost his plumpness. His smooth coat grew rough.
And his tail&mdash;that beautiful tail that Jimmy Rabbit had tried to cut
off&mdash;alas!<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_97' id='Page_97'>[Pg 97]</a></span> it was no longer beautiful. It was thin and ragged-looking.</p>

<p>At last Johnnie Green began to be worried about his pet squirrel. And
one day when Frisky refused to eat a single nut Johnnie Green thought
that he must be really ill. So he opened the door of the cage, which he
always kept carefully fastened, and forgetting all about his thick
gloves he put his hand inside the little wire house, picked Frisky up by
the back of his neck, just as if he were a kitten, and lifted him out of
his prison.</p>

<p>Johnnie wanted to see if he could find out what was the trouble with the
little fellow. He thought that perhaps he had a bad tooth, which
prevented his eating. And Johnnie tried to look inside of Frisky&#8217;s
mouth.</p>

<p>At first Frisky kept perfectly still. He<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_98' id='Page_98'>[Pg 98]</a></span> could hardly believe that he
was outside that horrid, cramped cage. But it was true! And when Johnnie
Green began to poke at his mouth with a bare finger Frisky Squirrel
thought that it was high time for him to do something.</p>

<p>So he did it. He didn&#8217;t wait another second. Quick as a flash he sank
his sharp teeth into Johnnie Green&#8217;s finger.</p>

<p>Poor Johnnie Green! He gave such a yell that you could have heard him
far away on the other side of Swift River. That was the first thing he
did. And the next thing that Johnnie did was to drop Frisky right on the
ground.</p>

<p>That was exactly what Frisky wanted. He no sooner touched the ground
than he was away like a shot. It was not at all like running inside the
wheel. Every leap carried him further away from Farmer Green&#8217;s house.
And he had<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_99' id='Page_99'>[Pg 99]</a></span> crossed the road and disappeared behind the stone-wall
before Johnnie Green knew what had happened.</p>

<p>For several days after that Johnnie Green had to keep his finger bound
up in a bandage. And he felt very sad at losing his pet squirrel.</p>

<p>But Frisky Squirrel was not sad at all. And neither was his mother. At
first, when Frisky tumbled inside her house she hardly knew him. For a
long time she had almost stopped believing he would ever come home
again. And now that he had come he was so changed that she could
scarcely believe it was he.</p>

<p>The first thing that Mrs. Squirrel did was to set before Frisky some
choice seeds which she had gathered that very day. And Frisky ate every
one of them. You see, he had found his appetite again.</p>

<p>For several days after that Frisky<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_100' id='Page_100'>[Pg 100]</a></span> Squirrel did very little except eat.
And it was surprising&mdash;the way he began to grow fat. His sides soon
stuck out more than they ever had before, and his coat began to grow
sleek and shiny. And as for his tail&mdash;though it took longer for <i>that</i>
to look beautiful again, in the course of time it became just as thick
and handsome as ever. Mrs. Squirrel was very glad of that. For Frisky
reminded her of his father once more.</p>

<h2>XXI</h2><h3>That Disagreeable Freddie Weasel</h3>
</div>

<p>Almost everybody liked Frisky Squirrel, he was such a happy little
fellow. But there were a few of the forest-people with whom Frisky never
was able to make friends. <i>They</i> were the disagreeable, selfish kind,
who never liked anyone except themselves.</p>

<p>Freddie Weasel was one of the few with whom Frisky Squirrel never could
have a good time. Frisky often tried to play with him. But their games
always ended in trouble; and I must say that it was not Frisky&#8217;s fault.</p>

<p>Now, Frisky had often heard it said<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_102' id='Page_102'>[Pg 102]</a></span> among his neighbors that no one had
ever caught Freddie Weasel asleep. Indeed, Jimmy Rabbit claimed that
Freddie Weasel never slept at all.</p>

<p>That seemed very strange to Frisky. He could hardly believe it. And he
made up his mind that he would watch Freddie Weasel and see whether it
was really true.</p>

<p>So one evening, just after sundown, when Frisky met Freddie Weasel in
the woods, he thought it would be a good time to spy upon him. Of course
it wasn&#8217;t at all a polite thing to do. But Frisky was very curious. And
anyhow, he meant no harm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Freddie!&#8221; he said, as he came face to face with the sly, slim
chap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, yourself!&#8221; said Freddie Weasel in a disagreeable tone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where you going?&#8221; Frisky inquired pleasantly enough.<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_103' id='Page_103'>[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Never you mind,&#8221; Freddie Weasel answered. &#8220;And you&#8217;d better keep out of
my way, or I&#8217;ll bite your head off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frisky Squirrel didn&#8217;t know what to say. Very few people&mdash;except Jasper
Jay and one or two other quarrelsome forest-folk&mdash;had ever spoken to him
like that. So he just stood still and stared.</p>

<p>That seemed to make Freddie angrier than ever. He darted toward Frisky
and tried to bite his neck. But Frisky was quick, too. He ran up a tree
before Freddie Weasel could catch him, and smiled at the bad-tempered
fellow.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better go home and take a nap,&#8221; Frisky told him. &#8220;You&#8217;re crosser
than ever to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Freddie looked up at Frisky as if he would just like to get hold of him
for about one second.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never sleep,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m always<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_104' id='Page_104'>[Pg 104]</a></span> awake. And some night when you&#8217;re
dreaming, I&#8217;m coming to your house and I&#8217;m going to eat you.&#8221; And then
he hurried away.</p>

<p>Frisky Squirrel ran down the tree and dashed after Freddie. He didn&#8217;t
make any noise at all. And he was careful not to let Freddie see him. He
was going to find out for himself whether Freddie stayed awake all
night.</p>

<p>Mrs. Squirrel was worried because Frisky didn&#8217;t come home. Of course he
ought to have let her know what he was about. But he felt that he
mustn&#8217;t lose sight of Freddie. And he saw no one at all by whom he could
send word to his mother as to where he was and what he was doing.</p>

<p>Frisky had the busiest sort of time following Freddie. It grew so dark
that it was very hard to see Freddie Weasel as he<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_105' id='Page_105'>[Pg 105]</a></span> sneaked along through
the bushes, hunting for small birds that build their nests on the
ground.</p>

<p>Freddie Weasel caught several sleeping birds. And Frisky could not help
being sorry for them. He began to feel very guilty for having teased
them, and for having eaten their eggs.</p>

<p>Finally it grew so dark that Frisky had just about decided that he would
have to give up spying on Freddie and hurry home, when he saw Freddie
slip into a hole in a bank and vanish.</p>

<p>Was Freddie Weasel at last going to bed and to sleep?</p>

<h2>XXII</h2><h3>Catching Freddie Weasel Asleep</h3>
</div>

<p>When Frisky Squirrel saw Freddie Weasel disappear in the hole in the
bank he became greatly excited. He forgot all about going home. And
though he had begun to feel somewhat sleepy, he was wide awake again in
no time. He sat right down, a little way from the hole, and he never
once took his eyes off it.</p>

<p>Frisky hoped that perhaps he would hear Freddie snoring in there, if he
waited long enough. But no such thing happened. There seemed to be but
one way to discover whether Freddie was asleep,<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_107' id='Page_107'>[Pg 107]</a></span> and <i>that</i> was to creep
into the hole himself and find out.</p>

<p>Now, Frisky Squirrel was no coward, as you know. But he did not like the
idea of crawling into that narrow, dark place. He knew that Freddie
Weasel&#8217;s teeth were very sharp. And he knew that Freddie was quick to
use them, too.</p>

<p>Frisky was trying hard to think of some good way to catch Freddie
asleep, when who should come strolling along but Henry Skunk! Frisky
always supposed that he was called &#8220;Henry&#8221; because he was so fond of
<i>hens</i>&mdash;for he visited Farmer Green&#8217;s hen-house oftener than any other
of the forest-people&mdash;but whether <i>that</i> was why he was so named I
should really not want to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well! You&#8217;re out pretty late,&#8221; Henry Skunk called, as soon as he
saw Frisky.<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_108' id='Page_108'>[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>Frisky Squirrel held a paw to his mouth, so Henry Skunk would not talk
too loudly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; Henry Skunk asked, with growing interest. &#8220;You
haven&#8217;t seen a hen around here, have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Frisky shook his head.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Freddie Weasel&mdash;&#8221; he explained, pointing at the hole. &#8220;He&#8217;s in
there; and I&#8217;m trying to catch him asleep.&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry Skunk came nearer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you go inside?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Frisky shook his head again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see very well in the dark,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I&#8217;d rather not.&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry nodded.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see first rate at night,&#8221; he told Frisky. &#8220;I&#8217;ll find out for you
if Freddie Weasel is asleep. And if he is, I&#8217;ll come right back and tell
you, and then you can go in with me and see for yourself.&#8221;<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_109' id='Page_109'>[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said Frisky. &#8220;That&#8217;s very kind of you, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Henry Skunk walked up to the hole. It was entirely too small for him
to enter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have to make it bigger,&#8221; he remarked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t Freddie hear you?&#8221; Frisky Squirrel inquired.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be very quiet about it,&#8221; Henry Skunk replied. &#8220;So if he&#8217;s asleep I
hardly think I&#8217;ll disturb him.&#8221; And at that Henry set to work.</p>

<p>Now, in order to dig, he had to stick his head into the hole. But he
knew he could see Freddie Weasel if Freddie tried to bite his nose; so
Henry was not afraid. How he did make the dirt fly! Frisky wished that
he could dig like that. He thought it must be great fun. And he watched
Henry so closely that he never saw that slim, sneaking form that crept
up behind<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_110' id='Page_110'>[Pg 110]</a></span> him. And when Frisky felt something jump right on top of him,
and when a terrible, sharp pain seized his shoulder, he was scared half
out of his wits.</p>

<p>It was Freddie Weasel! He had left his home through another hole, which
Frisky knew nothing about.</p>

<p>Frisky Squirrel called for help. He shouted Henry Skunk&#8217;s name again and
again, as he rolled over and over on the ground, trying to shake Freddie
off his back.</p>

<p>But how could Henry Skunk hear him, with his head buried inside the
hole? <i>He</i> didn&#8217;t know what was happening. And if Frisky and Freddie
hadn&#8217;t rolled right upon him he probably would never have looked around
until it was too late.</p>

<p>But when Henry felt that rolling, tumbling, fighting pair bump against
him he<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_111' id='Page_111'>[Pg 111]</a></span> drew his head out of the hole in a hurry. And as soon as he saw
what was happening he sunk his own sharp teeth deep into Freddie
Weasel&#8217;s back.</p>

<p>Freddie let go of Frisky Squirrel at once. And he gave Henry Skunk&#8217;s
nose such a savage nip that Henry just had to squeal&mdash;it hurt him so. In
order to squeal, of course he had to open his mouth. And when he opened
his mouth he had to let go of Freddie Weasel.</p>

<p>That was exactly what Freddie Weasel wanted. He sprang up and dashed
into the bushes. He was not afraid of Frisky Squirrel. But Henry Skunk
was altogether too big. Freddie did not enjoy fighting <i>him</i>.</p>

<p>Well! Frisky, with his aching shoulder, and Henry Skunk, with his sore
nose, went off together. They didn&#8217;t say a word to<span class='pagenum'><a name='Page_112' id='Page_112'>[Pg 112]</a></span> each other, until
they reached the hickory tree where Frisky lived. And then all they said
was &#8220;Good-night!&#8221;</p>

<p>Frisky never spied on anybody again. He had learned that it is better
not to meddle in other people&#8217;s private affairs. So, after all, perhaps
it was a good thing that he tried, just once, to catch Freddie Weasel
asleep.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
